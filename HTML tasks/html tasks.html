			What is a Gamebook?
		</h1>
		<p>
			A gamebook is a work of printed fiction that allows the reader to participate in the story by making <strong>choices</strong>. The <i>narrative
branches</i> along various paths, typically through the use of numbered paragraphs or pages. Production of new gamebooks
in the West <sub>decreased</sub> dramatically during the nineties as choice based stories have moved away from <sup>print based media</sup>.
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			Description
		</h2>
		<p>
			There are three types of gamebooks.<br> The first is the branching-plot novel, which require the reader to make choices but are
otherwise like a regular novel. These Gamebooks are sometimes informally called choose your own adventure books or
CYOA which is the name of the well known Choose Your Own Adventure series originally published by Bantam Books.<br> The
second type is the Solitaire adventure (an example of this is the Tunnels and Trolls series of gamebooks), which combines
the branching-plot novel with the rules of a role-playing game, allowing the game to be played without a Gamemaster but
may require the purchase of separate manuals.<br> The third type is the Adventure gamebook (examples of these are the
Fighting Fantasy and Lone Wolf series of gamebooks), which combines the branching-plot novel with a simple role-playing
system unique to the book (or series).

		<h3>
			Origins
		</h3>
		<p>
			Several influences contributed to the development of the gamebook format during the twentieth century. The possibility of
having stories branching out into several different paths seems to have been first suggested by Jorge Luis Borges in his
short story An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain (1941). This story features an author whose novel is a three-part
story containing two branch points, and with nine possible endings. Another story by Borges, titled "The Garden of Forking
Paths" (1941), also describes a book with a maze-like narrative reminiscent of modern gamebooks. These stories, however,
did not carry out the idea of branching-path narrative to full execution.
